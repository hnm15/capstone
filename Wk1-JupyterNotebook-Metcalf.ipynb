In preparation for Milestone One, create a Jupyter Notebook (similar to in Module B, semester two) that illustrates these lessons. There are no specific questions to answer in your Jupyter Notebook files in this course; your general goal is to analyze your data, using the methods you have learned about in this course and in this program, and draw interesting conclusions. \n",
